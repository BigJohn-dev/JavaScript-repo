//You are given three variables named LEFT_OPERAND, RIGHT_OPERAND, and OPERATOR. Write code for OPERATOR value does the following

let left_operand = 2;
let right_operand = 5;
let operator = "+ - * / NaN";

let add = left_operand + right_operand;
console.log(add + " This is the result for + operator");

let sub = right_operand - left_operand;
console.log(sub + " This is the result for - operator");

let multiply = left_operand * right_operand;
console.log(multiply + " This is the result for * operator");

let divide = left_operand / right_operand;
console.log( divide + " This is the result for / operator");

//let NaN = left_operand $ right_operand;
//console.log( NaN + " This is the result for other operators");
